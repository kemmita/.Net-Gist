1. If we go to our controller, we can see how the API should be called for each specific request. Get, Post, etc...

2. the url to call all books will be http://localhost:53222/api/Book
      // GET: api/Book
        public IHttpActionResult Get()
        {
            return Ok(books);
        }
3. the url to call a single book will be http://localhost:53222/api/Book/2
        // GET: api/Book/5
        public  IHttpActionResult Get(int id)
        {
            return Ok (books.Where(b=> b.Id == id));
        }
4. the url to create a book will be http://localhost:53222/api/Book so how does the code know if it is a Get or Post, becuase the
id in the params below is coming from the body and that is how it knows to differentiate between the two. 
        // POST: api/Book
        public void Post([FromBody]string value)
        {
        }
5. the url to update a book will be http://localhost:53222/api/Book/2
        // PUT: api/Book/5
        public void Put(int id, [FromBody]string value)
        {
        }
6. the url to delete a book will be http://localhost:53222/api/Book/2
        // DELETE: api/Book/5
        public void Delete(int id)
        {
        }
